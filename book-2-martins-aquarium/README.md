Once you have completed all of the Core Projects, your job is to do a self-assessment. Click on the link below to see what this book's assessment instructions are. Once complete, reach out to an mentor to review your vocabulary.

## üîê Deep Learning Projects Unlocked

These projects expand your knowledge of data, functions and modules. Each project has tests that run and verify that your code follows the requirements.

| #   | Project Name  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | [The&nbsp;Hairy&nbsp;Potter](../projects/tier-1/hairy-potter/) | This project has very specific requirements for how you should structure and organize your code. Attention to details is very important **before** you write your code. |
