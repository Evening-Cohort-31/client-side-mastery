This first self-assessment is for you to hone several Core Skills that you need as a software developer.

Taking your time now to be thorough, reflective, patient and curious will give you the foundation to be successful throughout the rest of this course and your career.

If you rush this, or think of it as a test to be "passed", then you will already be on the wrong path.


## Starter Code

Slim Jenkins has the existing code on Github, so you need to download it from there. Actually, developers call this process _cloning a repository_.

1. Go to the [Learning Platform](https://learning.nss.team) and click the button to start your self-assessment
2. You will receive a Slack message with the URL for your very own repository _(if this does not happen, contact one of the coaches immediately)_
3. Click on that URL
4. Click the **Code** button
5. Click on *SSH* in the window that appears
6. Copy that string
7. Go to your workspace directory
   ```sh
   cd ~/workspace
   ```
8. Then clone the repository to your machine with the following command.
   ```sh
   git clone {copy what you pasted here... no curly braces}
   ```
9. This will create a new sub-directory called `bug-wrangler-ranch`. Use the `cd` command to navigate into that directory and open it in VS Code.
    ```sh
    cd bug-wrangler-ranch
    code .
    ```
10. Read all of the instructions and get started fixing the bugs.
